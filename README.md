# Python Software Development Learning Path

## Overview
This learning path is designed to build a strong foundation in Python software development, focusing on best practices, testing, and design principles. The path progresses from basic concepts to advanced software architecture.

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python syntax knowledge
- Understanding of basic programming concepts
- Python 3.8+ installed
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Git for version control

## Path Structure

### 1. [Python Fundamentals Enhancement (Week 1-2)](./Python-Fundamentals-Enhancement.md)
- Project directory: `projects/library_system`
- Functions vs Classes - Making the Right Choice
  - Functional programming concepts
  - When to use functions (pure functions, side effects)
  - When to choose classes (state management, encapsulation)
  - Python-specific considerations vs Java/C# approaches
- Scoping and Namespaces
  - LEGB rule (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in)
  - Module organization
  - Import best practices

### 2. Testing Fundamentals (Week 2-3)
- Unit Testing Philosophy
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  - Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
- PyTest Deep Dive
  - Fixtures and their proper use
  - Parametrization
  - Mocking and patching
  - Test organization patterns
  - Coverage analysis
- Testing Patterns
  - Arrange-Act-Assert
  - Given-When-Then
  - Test doubles (mocks, stubs, fakes)

### 3. Object-Oriented Design (Week 4-5)
- OOP Fundamentals in Python
  - Inheritance vs Composition
  - Abstract classes and interfaces
  - Multiple inheritance and MRO
  - Properties and descriptors
- Design Patterns
  - Creational patterns
  - Structural patterns
  - Behavioral patterns
- Python-Specific OOP
  - Dunder methods
  - Metaclasses
  - Protocols and ABCs
  - Comparison with Java/C# OOP models

### 4. Clean Code and Best Practices (Week 6)
- Code Organization
  - Package structure
  - Module design
  - Dependency management
- SOLID Principles in Python
  - Single Responsibility
  - Open/Closed
  - Liskov Substitution
  - Interface Segregation
  - Dependency Inversion
- Code Quality
  - Type hints and static typing
  - Documentation standards
  - Linting and formatting
  - Code reviews

### 5. Domain-Driven Design (Week 7-8)
- DDD Fundamentals
  - Ubiquitous language
  - Bounded contexts
  - Aggregates and entities
- Strategic Design
  - Context mapping
  - Subdomains
  - Anti-corruption layers
- Tactical Design
  - Value objects
  - Entities
  - Aggregates
  - Domain events
  - Repositories

### 6. Advanced Architecture (Week 9-10)
- Application Architecture
  - Layered architecture
  - Hexagonal architecture
  - Event-driven architecture
- Design Considerations
  - Scalability
  - Maintainability
  - Testing strategies
  - Performance optimization

## Practical Projects
Throughout this learning path, you'll work on increasingly complex projects:

1. **Basic Library System**
   - Focus: Functions vs Classes, Basic Testing
   - Skills: PyTest, OOP basics

2. **E-commerce Domain**
   - Focus: DDD, Advanced Testing
   - Skills: Strategic DDD, Complex Testing Scenarios

3. **Event Management System**
   - Focus: Advanced Architecture
   - Skills: Event-driven design, Complex Domain Modeling
